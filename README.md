    All of the instructions that I have talked about in the first module had been implemented. This includes the basic arithmetic instruction -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division --  as well as the combat oriented instructions such as deploy or defend. My favorite instruction is the "heheheha" instruction that outputs laughing emojis to taunt your opponent.
