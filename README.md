# SUMMARY
    All of the instructions that I have talked about in the first module had been implemented. This includes the basic arithmetic instruction -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division --  as well as the combat oriented instructions such as deploy or defend. My favorite instruction is the "heheheha" instruction that outputs laughing emojis to taunt your opponent.
    

# HOWTO
    To run this custom language, you need to first need to upload the file into the custom langs folder. Then to compile using the build tool "javac BuildCustomLang.java"

    Then build a jar file of the language. "java BuildCustomLang ClashRoyaleAssembly.java"

    You have successfully implemented it into the simulator and the final step is to run Mars. "java Mars".
